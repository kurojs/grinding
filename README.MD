## Resource

### Data structure and Algorithm

#### Prefix sum

Prefix sum helps solve problems that require calculating the sum or range of continuous elements in an array. It is a powerful technique often used in competitive programming and technical interviews to optimize the performance of sum queries.

Sample question:

[https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/](leetcode/1.prefix-sum/range-sum-query-immutable.go)


### [Golang](https://go.dev/)

Golang is my most beloved programming language, because it clean, simple syntax but have powerful feature like concurrency, blazing fast, good toolbox (go vet, linter, gofmt, go mod, ..ect). Here are some resource that can help you strengthen your Go skill.

- [Go 101 books](https://go101.org/) My first Golang book I read, that help me learn core fundamental of Go. Good for starter.
- [Concurrency in Go](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/concurrency-in-go/9781491941294/) Famous book that help you deeply understanding concurrent concept and practical. High recommend for intermediate and upper Go learner.
- [Go Gotchas](https://yourbasic.org/golang/gotcha/) This blog help you point-out most mistake you can make when coding with very straightforward example and how to address the problem.

#### My public learning notes
